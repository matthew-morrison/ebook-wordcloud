# Ebook Wordcloud Creator

A python script which creates a wordcloud from an Ebook.

This is just a little script I wrote in late 2017 so I could easily see the most common words in my favourite books.

## Requirements

python3

wordcloud

`pip install wordcloud`

BeautifulSoup4

`pip install beautifulsoup4`

or

`apt-get install python3-bs4`

## Usage

If you have an ebook with the name "The Eye of the World - Robert Jordan.epub" you would use the following command.

`$python ebookart.py The Eye of the World - Robert Jordan.epub`

## Sidenote

I've added this code to Doraemon the python discord bot so that users can see wordclouds made out of the words they've said on the server.
